Let's see simple steps to deploy/create a **static blog with Forestry CMS using Stackbit on GitHub**. For this all you needed is

1. Sign Up for **[GitHub](https://github.com).**
2. Sign Up for **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**.
3. Sign Up for** [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/)**.
4. Sign Up for **[Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/)**.

After all **Sign in to Stackbit. Let's Start!**

   Then you will **redirect to theme selection page.** See Next Step...

2. ## Choose a "Theme" from the provided themes.

   Here I choose "**Azimuth**" as my theme you can choose any. After choosing your theme tap "**Continue to Site Generator ".**

   \--page-break--
3. ## Next, Choose a Static Site Generator.

   **I Recommend you to choose Jekyll**. Since we are concentrating on Jekyll more updates and help are available. If you are not willing to use Jekyll, **select a Static Generator.**

   After selecting a theme tap "**Continue to CMS**" to select a CMS.

4. ## Next, Choose a CMS (Content Management System).

   Since this tutorial is pointed on deploying blog with Forestry CMS. We select **Forestry**.

   ( We will soon upload the tutorial of all other CMS and Management.)

   After selecting CMS proceed to "**Connect Accounts**".
